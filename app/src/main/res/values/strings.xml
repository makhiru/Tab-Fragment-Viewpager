    <string name="text2">Markram to Holder, out Stumped!! Here\'s another W stumping for Rickelton! Floated up full and slow on off, Holder ran down the track and had a wild swipe at that one, he was through his shot way too early and it gripped and turned sharply past the inside edge. Rickelton gathered it cleanly and did the rest. Set batter gone now with nearly 7 overs still to [4s-3] go. Holder st Rickelton b Markram 36(43)</string>
